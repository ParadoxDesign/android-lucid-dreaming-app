    <h1>Welcome to Graph Viewer!</h1>
	Online Help: <a href="http://luciddreamingapp.com/help-how-to/analyze-data/">http://luciddreamingapp.com/help-how-to/analyze-data/</a></br></br>
	This activitiy displays graphs of data that was collected overnight. Graphs become available after 8 minutes 
	the app was running and may be autosaved every 10 minutes (if autosave option is enabled). You may manually save the graph before exiting the app.
	
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	
	Select "Load Graph" from the menu to view one of the graphs you have created. Graphs are stored in /Application Data/Lucid Dreaming App/Graph Data. 
	Their file name includes the moment when you started the app. Pick one of the graphs to load it.
	
	<h2>Interacting with axis and points</h2>
	Due to the small screen size, I'm including a lot of data in one plot. To ease the process of viewing, you can remove some data series from the graph
	by using the checkboxes below the plot. Multiple axis are introduced due to different scales of data series displayed.
	
	The plot axis are not labelled to save space. If you click on an axis, it's description and units are shown below the graph. Clicking on a point displays its value and timestamp below the graph. I'm working on turning the timestamp into a date.
	
	<h2>Axis and series</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Sleep score - Values less than 1 indicate sleep, otherwise awake</li>
	<li>Sleep episodes - value of 0 indicates awake, 10 falling asleep and 20 asleep</li>
	<li>Sleep duration rises with each minute you are asleep. This may be useful for estimating periods of sleep interruption</li>
	<li>Reminder played - shows the minute when a reminder was played. This info may be helpful in gauging the effectiveness of the app</li>
	<li>Awake, Dream, Lucid Dream, User Event - indicates minutes when the you interacted with the screen. These are shown as little ticks in the upper portion of the graph </li>
	</ul>
	
	Ticks are color coded and shown in the legend. Here's what they stand for:
	<ul>
	<li>X = reminder played that minute.</li>
		<li>O stands for both awake and no dream events</li>
			<li>Triangle stands for regular dreams</li>
				<li>Square stands for lucid dreams</li>
					<li>Diamond stands for other events and screen interactions</li>
	</ul>	
	
	
	<h2>Sleep Statistics</h2>
	Graphs include a statistical summary of that night's sleep. Here's the overview of some important metrics:
	<ul>
	<li>Sleep onset latency - time it takes to reach 5 consecutive minutes of sleep</li>
	<li>Sleep score - a user is considered asleep if the sleep score is less than 1 on 5 consecutive minutes</li>
	<li>Number of awakenings - number of times the app detected significant movement and think you were awake</li>
	<li>Number of user events - number of minutes when you interacted with the screen (max 1/minute) </li>
	<li>Longest sleep episode - longest period with sleep score of less than 1</li>
	</ul>
