 	<h1>Quick Manual calibration</h1>
 	
   Quickest calibration available! It will only take 2 minutes of your time!
 	
 	<h4>If the progress bar does not move:</h4>
 	Take the phone in your hand and gently roll it around, making the bar fill up. 
 	Proceed to move it until the bar fills up to full. It may stop at 99%, just keep moving the phone. The entire process typically takes less than 120 seconds. Upon completion, the activity will finish and show the clock screen or the preferences screen.
 	<br/>
 	Please note that this process does not adjust your phone's sleep scoring constant, rather giving you the 
 	default value (0.0034). If you experience abnormally high activity counts when the phone is at rest (>100), you may need to recalibrate your phone using extended calibration.
