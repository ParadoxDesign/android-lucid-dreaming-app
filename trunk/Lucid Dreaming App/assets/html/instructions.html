    <h1>Instructions</h1>
	
	This app is intended to collect activity data from your bed and play a voice reminder when the
	app thinks you are in light sleep. 
	
	Full instructions with pictures can be found at the official site: <a href="http://luciddreamingapp.com/">LucidDreamingApp.com</a>
	
	<h2>Calibration</h2>
	Your phone, your bed and your room are very different from the one used to develop this app. This is why the app has to be
	briefly calibrated. The app will not work without calibration. There's an override function for this available in preferences>sensitivity tuning.
		
	
	<h2>App Use</h2>
	App is started by the icon button on the main menu screen or from the menu>start app. This gives you a 45 second window to lay down the phone in it's regular spot and then go to bed as normal. 
	
	The app provides 3 modes of operation: graph, list and clock. List features black background and does not shine much light. This is the preferred way of working with the app at night. Gestures are only enabled in the list view. 
	</br>Graph shows sleep data delayed by 2 minutes. Press "Save" to save the graph data to /application data/lucid dreaming app/graph data
	<p></p>
	The app delivers voice reminders based on the settings in preferences>REM Detection Timing or REM Prediction. After looking at your sleep graphs, you will be able to estimate these settings. The default settings may not match your sleep pattern. 
	
	<p></p></br></br>Android app lifecycle events do not fit together very well with an app that is supposed to run whole night. Please start the app as the last thing you do before going to bed. Let it run uninterrupted.
	The "close" button kills the data collection activity completely (Android Market may hate me for this), but it ensures that no data is collected after you close the activity, and your graphs and data will be less corrupted by excessive motion.
	
	<h2>Gestures</h2>
	Gestures are sensitive to the direction in which they are drawn. The way you draw arrows or circles may be different from the way I do so. 
	If you find that the app does not recognize your gestures, start the gesture editor from the Preferences>Edit Gestures, hold the gesture 
	that you would like to delete and pick "Delete" from the context menu. You may then create another gesture with the same name. 
	
	The app only records one gesture per minute, so if your make a mistake entering a gesture, or the app thinks you entered something else, simply 
	scribble something on the screen and the gesture will be replaced with a generic "not recognized"</br>
	</br>
	You must use the same tags for gestures that you create. Valid tags are: dream, no dream, awake, lucid dream. Other tags will be marked as default "not recognized" by the app.
	
	<h2>Recording reminders</h2>
	You may use an MP3 or an MP4 reminder if you put it in the SDCard/Recordings folder. By default, the app will be looking for a file called "lucid.mp3". You can select another file from the preferences.
	<br> I use <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=yuku.mp3recorder.lite&feature=search_result">Hi-Q Mp3 recorder</a>  to record my reminders.
	
	To check if your voice reminder is working, select "play voice reminder" from the preferences.

	<h2>Device Placement</h2>
	Place your phone a reasonable distance away from your pillow. Recommended: 16 inches/40 cm away from the center of the pillow, 
	where your head will rest. Orient one of device's edges towards the pillow.   
	
	<h2>Sleep Detection</h2>
	The device scores each minute of sleep according to Cole's sleep detection algorithm. It looks at the 
	previous 4 minutes of sleep and calculates your sleep score. If it is less than 1, the algorithm considers you asleep.
	Calibration automatically picks a good constant to use for the algorithm. If you think the device is not sensitive enough,
	you can lower the Cole constant in preferences.
	
	</br></br>This sleep scoring algorithm is best at detecting movement after long periods of inactivity. The exact duration of these
	can be set in preferences> behaviors. It is recommended to use longer periods earlier in the night and shorter ones late at night.
	Keep an eye on your total time asleep. If you find it lacking, consider reducing your use of the app for lucid dreaming induction and use it as
	an actigraph instead. 
	</br>
	Note that getting in and out of bed creates very large activity spikes on the graph, potentially dwarfing all other activity. Handling the phone or turning it over will create gigantic spikes, which are hard to deal with. Either a graph has to be cut off or a logarithmic axis have to be introduced. Both options are not ideal...
	
	 
	
	<h2>Data, Analysis and Export Options</h2>
	The app allows you to save data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for plotting by the application and analysis by other web tools.
	Additionally, you can set the app to create a comma separated minute-by-minute log of your activity for analysis and plotting in tools like Excel.
	Especially for sleep research, there's an option to enable very frequent data logging for a very detailed view of what's happening at night.    
	
	<h2>Other Apps</h2>
	Please kill other apps, so they allow more processing power to collect and analyze data on the fly. This
	may be especially important on the old phones of Droid series.
	
	<h2>Power</h2>
	The device must be plugged in to avoid running out of battery. The computation algorithm is memory and CPU intensive and
	may drain your battery quickly.
	
	<h2>Safety</h2>
	I don't know if sleeping with a phone so close to your head is safe from the radiation standpoint. But you keep it in your pocket, right?
	So I disclaim all liability in this case. Please check if your phone's manufacturer issued a battery recall for your phone, as some cheap lithium
	batteries may burst into flames! You don't want your bed on fire, do you ? :P
