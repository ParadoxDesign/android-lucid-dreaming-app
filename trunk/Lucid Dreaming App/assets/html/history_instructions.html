    <h1>History Instructions</h1>
	History activity allows you to visually compare your recent sleep history and determine the best time to go to sleep
	</br>
	For illustrated help, please follow this link <a href="http://luciddreamingapp.com/help-how-to/work-with-history/">http://luciddreamingapp.com/help-how-to/work-with-history/</a>
	
	
	<h2>History Use</h2>
	
	History works best if you have the OI File manager, this way you can navigate to any folder where you may put several graphs to plot.
	</br> Without the file manager, the program will default to selecting files from the /graph data directory. It will do it's best to pick the 7 latest files over 5kb and show them as history.
	I expect the 7 file limitation to be lifted some time in the future, as I test device capabilities. There's quite a lot of work involved in creating history, so some slower devices may think the app froze.
	
	<h3>Create History Button</h3>
	Press once if you don't have OI File manager, the app will create a history from up to 7 latest graphs in your /sdcard/application data/lucid dreaming app/graph data folder.
	Using OI File Manager, Navigate to the folder where you have 1 or more sleep graphs to analyze. This can be the default folder, or some folder where you put a few graphs to plot. Click "pick" the folder. Wait for the graph to generate.
	
	</br></br> /sdcard/application data/lucid dreaming app/graph data
	</br> You may find it easier to put all the graphs you want to see in history in one folder and then select that folder to plot.
			
	When this folder is picked, the app automatically picks .txt.gzip and .txt files to graph. They must be over 5kb in size (approx 2+ hours of data).
	It may take a few seconds for your phone to format data for presentation on a single graph. 
		
	Try plotting the last 7 days as a history, or plot weekends or weekdays separately. Maybe there are some days when you took sleeping aids and would like to
	see how they affected your sleep? Pick those days and create a history file from them!
	
	<h3>REM Events</h3>
	History includes a segmented red line indicating where the REM Events are expected. This line is a visual representation where the Smart Timer would be looking for
	REM events. Adjust this line by  <a href="http://luciddreamingapp.com/help-how-to/configure-smart-timer/">following these instructions</a>. A hypnogram (black stepped line) 
	is inculuded to help you visualize how the sleep may progress. 
	
	<h2>Saving History</h2>
	Once the history is created, you have an option of saving it as a History_[date].txt.gzip file to view in the future. Or maybe you want to compare it to your friends' history? In either case, it is 
	recommended that you give it a descriptive filename using one of the file managers.
	
	<h2>Loading History</h2>
	By default history files are saved in /application data/lucid dreaming app/history. Click "Load History" to pick one of these files. One sample file is provided with the App. 
	
	
	<h2>Graph Interpretation</h2>
	In the current release [Beta 0.5.3] history presents total time asleep for the nights selected, along with dream, awakening and lucid dream data, all on one graph. For more
	info on how to interpret history, please follow this link: <a href="http://luciddreamingapp.com/help-how-to/work-with-history/">http://luciddreamingapp.com/help-how-to/work-with-history/</a>
